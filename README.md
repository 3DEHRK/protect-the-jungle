## 🪁✨ Getting started 🚀🎯
1. Check out the C++ Hints below 💪
2. Take a look at the Entity class (line ~200) 🤔
3. See what functions the Game class offers by reading it's comments (line ~250) ☺️
4. Get a glimpse of how exisitng game entities work (line ~650) 🤓👆
5. Commit something & have fun! 💜

<br/>

## C++ Hints
### std::vector: Array like container with extra functionality
### Entity* entity = new Entity(); A pointer variable that holds the memory adress of an object (created on the heap)
### to access a member through a pointer you use ptr->do() instead of obj.do()
### Zombie& zombie; & means take the object by reference instead of copying it
